    Once inside you can specify the name of the application and choose the platform, which are mandatory fields.  There are also optional fields such as setting an App Icon, choosing the category, entering the Bundle ID, enter the URL scheme, and enter the iTunes URL.  These fields do not have any effect on the app itself but can often serve as a repository for useful information needed later.
