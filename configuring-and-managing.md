#Configuring and Managing

##Creating an App

Setting up an App in Burstly allows you to identify the specific application where you wish to run ads.

1. Go to [[Burstly Web UI|http://burstly.com]]
2. Click Login and enter credentials.
3. Select the "Setup an App" button located in the middle of the page.

4. Define App Information

    Once inside you can specify the name of the application and choose the platform, which are mandatory fields.  There are also optional fields such as setting an App Icon, choosing the category, entering the Bundle ID, enter the URL scheme, and enter the iTunes URL.  These fields do not have any effect on the app itself but can often serve as a repository for useful information needed later.  


##Creating a Zone

Zones are physical locations within the app where ads are trafficked and presented to the user.

1. Click "Create New Zone"  

   After you have created an app in Burstly, click on the name to enter the Manage Zones page. Navigate inside the app and click "Create New Zone", then enter a unique name for the zone which will help identify this placement when running reports and assigning ads. We suggest adding either the dimensions or placement name here as well, an example would be "Basketball App 320x50 Banner Zone"
