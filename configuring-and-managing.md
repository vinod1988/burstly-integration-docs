##Creating an App

Setting up an App in Burstly allows you to identify the specific application where you wish to run ads.

1. Go to [[Burstly Web UI|http://burstly.com]]
2. Click Login and enter credentials.
3. Select the "Setup an App" button located in the middle of the page.

Once inside you can specify the name of the application and choose the platform, which are mandatory fields.  There are also optional fields such as setting an App Icon, choosing the category, entering the Bundle ID, enter the URL scheme, and enter the iTunes URL.  These fields do not have any effect on the app itself but can often serve as a repository for useful information needed later.

4. Define App Information

For ease of use we often recommend creating a different app for each separate SKU/Market Build.  This will allow you to traffic ads without having to device target campaigns & ads.  However, if you have a Universal app choosing either iPhone or iPad will serve the same purpose and you can device target appropriately.
